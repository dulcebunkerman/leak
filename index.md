## Welcome to GitHub Pages

You can use the [editor on GitHub](https://github.com/dulcebunkerman/leak/edit/master/index.md) to maintain and preview the content for your website in Markdown files.

Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.

### Markdown

Markdown is a lightweight and easy-to-use syntax for styling your writing. It includes conventions for

```markdown
Syntax highlighted code block

# Header 1
## Header 2
### Header 3

- Bulleted
- List

1. Numbered
2. List

**Bold** and _Italic_ and `Code` text

[Link](url) and ![Image](src)
```

For more details see [GitHub Flavored Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/).

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/dulcebunkerman/leak/settings). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.

## Nazgul Files

```
The Nazgul Files are a series of emails I've been able to MITM and steal (with help, tho can't say from who yet) from some of Nazgul's field agents. I guess they don't take security protocol as seriously as you'd think for a corporation of their nature. Or they were just so bold they didn't think anyone would even try it. 

Anyways, I'm going to start making some of my more interesting findings available. I'm not much of a hacker, more of a gamer, so I'm sorry that this site doesn't look better and isn't better organized. It took a lot of work to even intercept what I have now, so I'm not really sure if I'll have more updates later, or how frequent they'll be if I do.

Lastly, it is imperative that before showing this to anyway that you vet them thoroughly. Nazgul and their lackeys have ears in all sorts of places, and I can't risk being exposed. Like I said, not a hacker, I have no idea if what I did to get these could lead back to me or not.
